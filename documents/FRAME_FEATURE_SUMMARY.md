# Frame Feature Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a Frame element for the canvas, similar to Figma frames. Users can now group objects together in frames and manage them as cohesive units.

## Implementation Date

January 13, 2025

## Features Implemented

### 1. Frame Creation

- **Multi-Select Framing**: Select multiple objects and use the "Frame" button in the toolbar to wrap them in a frame
- **Automatic Sizing**: Frame automatically calculates its size based on the bounding box of selected objects
- **Padding**: 10px padding is added around the content for visual clarity
- **Design**:
  - Background color: `#f6f6f6`
  - Border: `1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)`
  - Border radius: `10px`
  - Always-visible label: "Frame" displayed at the top-left

### 2. Frame Unframing

- **Unframe Action**: Select a frame and click the "Unframe" button to remove the frame while keeping its children
- **Child Preservation**: All objects within the frame are preserved and remain at their positions
- **Selection**: After unframing, all former children are automatically selected

### 3. Parent-Child Relationships

- **ParentId Property**: Children objects store their parent frame's ID in the `parentId` field
- **Frame Children Array**: Frames maintain a `children` array with IDs of all contained objects
- **Z-Index Management**: Frames render behind their children for proper layering

### 4. Dragging Behavior

- **Move with Children**: When dragging a frame, all its children move along with it
- **Relative Positioning**: Children maintain their positions relative to the frame
- **Multi-Select Support**: Can select and drag frames along with other objects

### 5. Resizing Behavior

- **Proportional Scaling**: When resizing a frame, children are scaled proportionally
- **Position Adjustment**: Children's positions are adjusted to maintain their relative location within the frame
- **Size Scaling**: Children's sizes are scaled by the same factor as the frame

### 6. Deletion Behavior

- **Cascade Delete**: Deleting a frame also deletes all its children
- **Safety**: Regular object deletion remains unchanged

## Files Modified

### Configuration Files

1. **`src/config/objectBehaviors.json`**
   - Added "frame" action to multiSelect actions
   - Added "frame" action definition with icon, label, and tooltip

### Factory Functions

2. **`src/utils/objectFactory.ts`**
   - Created `createFrame()` function
   - Generates frames with proper default properties

### Component Updates

3. **`src/components/CanvasObject.tsx`**

   - Added frame rendering case in `renderContent()`
   - Frame displays with proper styling and always-visible label

4. **`src/components/ContextToolbar.tsx`**

   - Added "Frame" icon (Square) to toolbar
   - Made "Reframe" button context-aware:
     - Shows "Frame" for multi-select
     - Shows "Unframe" for frames
     - Shows "Reframe" for other objects

5. **`src/components/MultiSelectToolbar.tsx`**
   - Connected `onReframe` prop to frame creation handler

### Core Logic

6. **`src/App.tsx`**

   - Implemented `handleFrameSelection()` to create frames around selected objects
   - Implemented `handleUnframe()` to remove frames and release children
   - Updated `handleDelete()` to cascade delete frame children
   - Updated object rendering sort order to ensure frames render before children

7. **`src/hooks/useDrag.ts`**
   - Modified `updateObjectDrag()` to move children with frames
   - Modified `updateResize()` to scale children proportionally when resizing frames

## User Experience Flow

### Creating a Frame

1. Select multiple objects on the canvas (Shift+Click or Box Selection)
2. Multi-select toolbar appears with a "Frame" button (Square icon)
3. Click the "Frame" button
4. A frame wraps around the selected objects with 10px padding
5. The new frame is automatically selected

### Unframing

1. Select a frame object
2. The toolbar shows an "Unframe" button (Maximize2 icon)
3. Click the "Unframe" button
4. The frame is removed, and all its children are selected

### Interacting with Frames

- **Drag**: Click and drag a frame to move it with all its children
- **Resize**: Drag the corner handles to resize the frame and scale its contents
- **Delete**: Press Delete/Backspace to remove the frame and all its children
- **Select Children**: Click individual children inside a frame to select them independently

## Technical Details

### Frame Object Structure

```typescript
interface FrameObject extends BaseCanvasObject {
  type: "frame";
  createdBy: "human" | "agent";
  autoLayout: boolean;
  layout: LayoutType;
  padding: number;
  gap: number;
  children: string[];
  backgroundColor?: string;
  borderRadius?: number;
  gridColumns?: number | "auto-fit";
}
```

### Default Frame Properties

- `backgroundColor`: "#f6f6f6"
- `borderRadius`: 10px
- `padding`: 10px
- `gap`: 10px
- `autoLayout`: false (manual positioning)
- `createdBy`: "human"

## Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)

1. **Auto Layout**

   - Implement automatic horizontal/vertical stacking
   - Support for grid layouts
   - Dynamic spacing based on `gap` property

2. **Frame Behaviors**

   - Clip children to frame bounds
   - Allow dragging children in/out of frames
   - Support nested frames

3. **Advanced Interactions**

   - Resize frame to fit contents
   - Distribute children evenly
   - Align children within frame

4. **Visual Enhancements**
   - Show padding guides when selected
   - Highlight drop zones when dragging objects near frames
   - Show child count badge

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Basic Operations**

   - Create frame from 2-5 selected objects
   - Unframe and verify children remain
   - Delete frame and verify children are removed

2. **Drag Behavior**

   - Drag frame and verify children move with it
   - Drag child independently inside frame
   - Drag frame with mixed selection

3. **Resize Behavior**

   - Resize frame and verify children scale proportionally
   - Test all four corner handles
   - Verify minimum size constraints

4. **Edge Cases**
   - Frame a single object
   - Frame objects that are already framed
   - Unframe empty frame
   - Nested frames (if supported)

## Conclusion

The Frame feature has been successfully implemented with full support for:

- Creating frames from selections
- Unframing to release children
- Dragging frames with children
- Resizing frames with proportional child scaling
- Proper parent-child relationships
- Z-index management

The implementation follows the existing codebase patterns and integrates seamlessly with the toolbar system, selection system, and drag/resize functionality.
